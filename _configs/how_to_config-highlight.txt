How to use config-highlight.cfg
Installation:
1) Ensure IDLE is closed
2) Open your .idlerc file, usually in your home directory
3) Paste in the settings and save
4) Open IDLE, Options -> Configure
5) Under the Highlighting tab, Obsidian should now be a custom theme available in the dropdown list.


On Windows, you will want to create/edit %userprofile%.idlerc\config-highlight.cfg then proceed with steps 3 - 5.

On Ubuntu you need to go into the .idlerc folder and edit 2 files
config-main.cfg
Add the following,
[Theme]
default = 0
name = Obsidian

In, config-highlight.cfg, copy and paste the code above.

You will probably need to create both of those files, and it may be better to go in to Options -> configure and save the default one so it generates the files itself, then edit them to add in the above theme.
